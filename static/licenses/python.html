A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE<br/>==========================<br/><br/>Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting<br/>Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands<br/>as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's<br/>principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.<br/><br/>In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for<br/>National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)<br/>in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the<br/>software.<br/><br/>In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to<br/>BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same<br/>year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope<br/>Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software<br/>Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a<br/>non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related<br/>Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of<br/>the PSF.<br/><br/>All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for<br/>the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python<br/>releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes<br/>the various releases.<br/><br/>    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-<br/>                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute<br/>    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The<br/>    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with<br/>    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.<br/><br/>(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,<br/>    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to<br/>    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1<br/>    is &quot;not incompatible&quot; with the GPL.<br/><br/>Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's<br/>direction to make these releases possible.<br/><br/><br/>B.
