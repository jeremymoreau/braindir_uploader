BrainDir Uploader is a purpose-built desktop upload client for the [LORIS](http://mcin-cnim.ca/neuroimagingtechnologies/loris/) Neuroimaging database platform. It was built with large MEG and MRI dataset uploads in mind and adds resume capabilities on top of standard SFTP. Its purpose is to provide reliable data transfer and a user friendly graphical front-end for uploading and inserting data into LORIS.
